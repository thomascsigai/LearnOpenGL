This repository contains the code to complete the tutorials from the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) website. The aim is to provide a solid foundation in OpenGL by implementing all the examples and exercises from the site. Currently, only the "Getting Started" section has been completed.

## üìù Introduction

This project is based on the "Getting Started" chapters from the LearnOpenGL tutorial. It covers the essentials needed to start with OpenGL, including window creation, shader compilation, vertex data management, drawing objects, using textures, and implementing basic transformations and camera navigation. By the end of these chapters, you should be equipped with the fundamental knowledge to create and manipulate a 3D scene.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### Getting Started

- **Window Creation**: Set up an OpenGL window using GLFW.
- **Shader Compilation**: Load and compile vertex and fragment shaders.
- **Vertex Data Management**: Use VBOs, VAOs, and EBOs to manage vertex data.
- **Drawing Objects**: Render basic shapes like triangles and quads.
- **Textures**: Load and apply textures to objects.
- **Transformations**: Apply transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling.
- **Coordinate Systems**: Understand and implement local, world, view, and clip space transformations.
- **Camera**: Implement a basic camera to navigate the 3D scene.
